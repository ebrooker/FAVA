Here is an updated list of diagnostics we should consider using in this 
work:

- velocity fluctuations pdf (bulk motion removed; total+ fuel+ ash)
- density fluctuations pdf (total+)
- pressure fluctuations pdf (this will require obtaining average radial 
pressure profile inside the window,total+)
- pdf divv (total+)
- pdf vorticity (total+)
- pdfs of velocity dot products
- KE spectra (total+)
- integral of KE spectra to compare against Ek(window) and mean grav 
energy injection rate
- Helmholtz decomposition (total+)
- velocity structure functions
- velocity autocorrelation

- velocity dot products autocorrelation
- divv-igtm cross-correlation as a function of fuel amount (closeness to 
the flame front)
